Long time no posting!

I decided to delete my facebook account. Couple of reasons, as to why:

* Got fed up with the content people posted in facebook
* Realized that I can contact almost all of my friends and relatives by other means
* Got fed up with the constant privacy infrictions facebook orchestrates


As it should be apparent, all of my current contact information can be found on this site. If you'd like to receive rare emails from me, for example invitations to an event, please provide your e-mail address. :)
